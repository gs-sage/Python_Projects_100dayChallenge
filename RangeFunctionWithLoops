# Range is a function in python used in conjunction with another function
# using range and the for loop to work the Gauss's problem
# Gauss problem is the total of numbers from 1 to 100

# we know the range has to be from 1 to 101 since range doesn't include the last number

# creating a variable to store current value to add the numbers to
gauss_num = 0

# using for loop to iterate through the range.
# the variable total will iterate through values 1 to 100
# we add each value to the gauss_num variable
# every time it goes through the range the value of gauss_num gets added

for total in range(1, 101):
    print(total)
    gauss_num = gauss_num + total # adding the value of total to the gauss_num variable in each iteration

# finally printing the total value
print(gauss_num)
