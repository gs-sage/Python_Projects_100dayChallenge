# First project of python course on Day 2
# Created a tip calculator that takes input from user for how much they would like to add to tip %
# The program takes integers, floats as output
# I didn't add a exception checker and the output verifier as this is a simple program 
# and explicitly asking for float will give an error if user tries to enter anything outside of a number
# Although I haven't checked but negatives could be used as a loophole

print("Welcome to the tip calculator!")

# Notes by Gaurav Saymi
# Note all input function will have a data type of string
# they will need to be converted to either float or int for this program to work

# Converted these to floats to have the flexibility of having the tip variable with any desired percentage not only integers

bill = float(input("What was the total bill? $"))
tip = float(input("What percentage tip would you like to give? (From 10% - desired %) "))
people = float(input("How many people to split the bill? "))

#making new variable to give the total after the tip is added in total

total_with_tip = bill * tip / 100 + bill

# print(total_with_tip)

total_after_split = round(total_with_tip / people, 2)

# print(total_after_split)

print(f"Each person should pay : ${total_after_split} dollars.")
