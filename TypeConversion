# Understanding use of len function in python and the use of function type

print(len("12345"))

# type will accept any data type and return the data type

print(type(100.23))
print(type(123))
print(type(True))
print(type("String"))

# Type conversion

print("123" + "456")

print(int("123") + int("456"))

# cannot concatenate string and integer but changing the + sign to comma makes it so that they are not added but separate
print("Number of letters in your name: ", len(input("Enter your name")))

#second way to do it would be to make variables.
username = input("Enter your name : ")
length_of_name = len(username)
print("Number of letters in your name: " + str(length_of_name))

#third way is sto use str directly

print("Number of letters in your name: " + str(len(input("Enter your name"))))
