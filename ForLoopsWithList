fruits = ["Apple", "Peach", "Pear"] 

# creating a variable fruit that will be used in the for loop
# the for loop will use the variable fruit to iterate through the list fruits
# it will assign the values in the list to the variable fruit one at a time

# this loop prints each value in the list separately
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)

# using the same for loop we can concatenate to individual values for fruit
# in this case we added pie to the end of string
# since fruits is a list of strings this will work
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit + " pie")

# we can also use integers and the idea is the same

numbers_num = [1,2,3]

for nums in numbers_num:
    print(nums)

# we can use any mathematical operators to perform actions in integers

for nums in numbers_num:
    print(nums * 2)
    print(nums + 3)
    print(nums / 2)
